# Template Comparison

This document provides a comparison between our CareerCraft resume template and the [basic-typst-resume-template](https://github.com/stuxf/basic-typst-resume-template) that inspired its design.

## Similarities

- ATS-friendly layout and structure
- Section-based organization with clear headings
- Grid-based alignment for key information
- Customizable accent colors
- Support for multiple sections (Education, Experience, Skills, etc.)

## Enhancements in CareerCraft

- **Internationalization**: Added support for German (DIN 5008) format
- **Integration**: Paired with a matching cover letter template for a complete application package
- **Flexibility**: More positioning options for header elements
- **Modularity**: Enhanced structure for easier customization

## Implementation Notes

When enhancing our resume template, we incorporated several key design principles from the basic-typst-resume-template:

1. The section heading style with accent-colored underlines
2. The grid-based layout for section content
3. Support for social/professional online profiles
4. ATS-friendly text hierarchy

We'd like to express our gratitude to Stephen Xu for creating the original template that served as an excellent foundation for our enhancements.

## Usage Differences

The CareerCraft template is designed to integrate seamlessly with our cover letter template, providing a consistent application package. While the basic-typst-resume-template focuses exclusively on resumes, our package offers a more comprehensive solution for job applications.
